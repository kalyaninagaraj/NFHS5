# Read and store NFHS-5 data (district-level summaries only) from official pdf documents
I wrote these tutorial-style notebooks when I was learning to use the fitz and PyPDF2 packages in Python for reading text from PDFs.

1. Step 1: [Download State and District-level PDFs](https://nbviewer.org/github/kalyaninagaraj/NFHS5/blob/main/DownloadPDFs.ipynb)
2. Step 2: [Pickle the Indicators](https://nbviewer.org/github/kalyaninagaraj/NFHS5/blob/main/PickleIndicators.ipynb) 
3. Step 3: [Save district-level statistics to DataFrame](https://nbviewer.org/github/kalyaninagaraj/NFHS5/blob/main/WriteToDataFrame.ipynb)
